<br><br>

Welcome to SBA308A, where I developed [BingeBuddy](https://bingebuddy-su-t.netlify.app/), a web application that allows users to search for TV shows and add them to their watchlist using the TMDB API. This project was built as part of an assignment for the Per Scholas Software Engineering Bootcamp to enhance my backend development skills.
